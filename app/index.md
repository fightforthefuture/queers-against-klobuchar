# Queers Against Klobuchar

## Mass surveillance makes LGBTQ people less safe.

We are disgusted that Republican war-hawks in Congress have exploited the Pulse Nightclub Massacre, one of the worst attacks on LGBTQ+ communities of color in U.S. history, to call for even more invasive spying that does nothing to keep us safe. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has caved to their perverse fear-mongering and voted in favor of a bill that would give the FBI access to our online activity, including search and browsing history, with no warrant.

## Mass surveillance will not stop violence against Black and Brown queer bodies.

We know from history and experience that state surveillance disproportionately affects queer people and people of color.

* [Police surveillance](http://www.thestonewallinnnyc.com/StonewallInnNYC/HISTORY.html), harassment and raids were the catalyst that led to Queer and Trans people of color the Stonewall Riot that was honored at Pride celebrations not a week after the attack in Orlando.

* The [Lavender Scare](http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2013/04/26/9-things-to%C2%A0know-about-lavender-scare) in the 1950’s and the [Sex Deviant](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/us/politics/uncovered-papers-show-past-government-efforts-to-drive-gays-from-jobs.html?_r=0) program that the FBI oversaw for decades collected massive amounts of data on government workers suspected and accused of being gay, and used the data to discredit, fire and otherwise harass workers, putting them in extreme danger.

* Non-violent Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin was subjected to extreme intelligence efforts via [COINTELPRO](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/1/8/it_was_time_to_do_more) for being both gay and Black and still wanting to be free.

* Currently, [trans women](https://www.aclu.org/blog/arrested-walking-while-trans-interview-monica-jones?redirect=blog/lgbt-rights-criminal-law-reform-hiv-aids-reproductive-freedom-womens-rights/arrested-walking) of color are profiled as sex workers, and men meeting in [parks](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-gay-stings-police-20160527-snap-story.html) have been targets of sting operations.

* Organizers and activists in the movement for Black lives are being [heavily surveilled](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/07/homeland-security-surveillance-black-lives-matter) not just in protest but also at home and at music and cultural events.

We implore our nation’s leaders to STOP expanding warrantless mass surveillance, and to STOP exploiting tragedies in LGBT communities in order to pass legislation that will hurt us more than nearly anyone else.

## What did Klobuchar do?

Klobuchar voted for [McCain Amendment 4787](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-06-22-the-senate-is-one-vote-away-from-giving-the-fbi/), a measure that would give the FBI unprecedented warrantless access to online communications records. This legislation was pushed by Republican lawmakers who never waste an opportunity to expand the police state in the wake of a crisis. The measure failed by one vote, and Republican leaders are planning to do a re-vote as soon as they find one more senator to support it.

Republicans have failed to even acknowledge that the Pulse Nightclub Massacre was a hate crime, possibly the worst in U.S. history. Instead, they mischaracterized the tragedy as solely an act of Islamic extremism, for which the only solution is giving up what little existing privacy the government hasn't already taken away.

Mass surveillance disproportionately harms queer and trans people of color. By aligning herself with Republicans, Klobuchar is expanding the damage already done to queer and trans communities throughout the country. Klobuchar has a historically terrible record on Internet-related issues (she supported [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act), the dramatically-failed Internet censorship bill), but there is still time for her to change her mind before the measure comes up for a re-vote!
