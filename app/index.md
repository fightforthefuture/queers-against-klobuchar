# Queers Against Klobuchar

## Join the rally! Mass surveillance harms our community.

In the wake of the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Republican war-hawks in Congress mischaracterized the tragedy to ignore the fact that this was the worst hate-crime against the queer and trans community in U.S. history. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) bought into their fear-mongering and voted in favor of a measure that would allow the FBI warrantless access to our online communications, including search and browser history.
