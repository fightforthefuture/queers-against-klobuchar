Dear Senator Klobuchar,

Please don't support knee-jerk legislation that gives the FBI warrantless access to our online communications. Mass surveillance disproportionately harms the queer and trans community.

We cannot allow the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando to be used as justification to further strip away our rights.

Please vote against McCain Amendment 4787 and any appropriations bill that includes ECTR provisions to expand the FBI's authority to engage in warrantless surveillance of online communications.

Thank you,
