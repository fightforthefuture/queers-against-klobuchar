Dear Senator Klobuchar,

Don't allow the Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando to be used as justification to further strip away our rights. Mass surveillance disproportionately harms queer and trans people of color by decreasing privacy and digital security, and increasing risk of discrimination, harassment, and physical violence.

Please vote against McCain Amendment 4787 and any bill that would expand the FBI's authority to engage in warrantless surveillance of online communications.

Thank you,
